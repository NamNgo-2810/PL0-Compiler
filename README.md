# PL0-Compiler
In present I wrote Scanner for Token Analysis and Parser for Syntax Analysis  
How to build (require your PC installed gcc): In Terminal type: ```gcc main.cpp pttv.cpp ptcp.cpp -o PL0.exe```  
How to run after build: In Terminal type: ```PL0.exe [file_name.pl0]``` (you have to prepare pl0 source file)
