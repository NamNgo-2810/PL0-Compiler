# PL0-Compiler
I'm HUST student learning Language and Compiler - lectured by Mr. Pham Dang Hai  
Class Code: 126526  
In the class we have to write a PL0 compiler in C/C++  
Maybe I'm the only one who truly dive into and write the code  
Well, because Teacher does not public the source code (he required we to write by ourshelves),  
I shared the code I wrote, hope them help you for this class (you can give me a star to this repo as an appreciation)  
In present I wrote Scanner for Token Analysis and Parser for Syntax Analysis  
How to build (require your PC installed gcc): In Terminal type: ```gcc main.cpp pttv.cpp ptcp.cpp -o PL0.exe```  
How to run after build: In Terminal type: ```PL0.exe [file_name.pl0]``` (you have to prepare pl0 source file)
